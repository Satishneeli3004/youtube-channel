The Bash+CLI folder has some powerful scripts that combine the features of Linux Bash and AWS CLI which let you do some cool things.

#### First example:
 you could quickly provision an EC2 by calling an script like this:
``` 
./runInstanceDefaultVPC

``` 

And you have an instance running!!
Remember to make the file executable and to rename the key to that you own.

#### Second Example:
You can combine bash+CLI to describe tags for all your Elastic Load Balancers on a certain region.
You can find this script under Bash+CLI/ELB/ folder   or by [clicking here](https://github.com/ravsau/AWS-CLI-Commands/tree/master/Bash%2BCLI/ELB)
